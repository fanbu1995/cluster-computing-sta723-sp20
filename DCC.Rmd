## DCC (Duke Computing Cluster) basic info

- Formerly known as the “DSCR” (Duke Shared Cluster Resource)
- 628 compute nodes with 15667 CPU cores (as of April 2019)
- Most nodes are purchased by labs and depts
- Some are provided by the University
- 1000 TB of primary storage (Isilon X-series)
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
- Uses the Slurm job queueing system


## Getting started (Login)

Log in by (make sure you have access to DCC first!)

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
ssh netID@dcc-slogin.oit.duke.edu
```

You will be automatically assigned to one of the following login nodes:

- `dcc-slogin-01`
- `dcc-slogin-02`
- `dcc-slogin-03`

DCC can only be accessed from within the Duke Network. If you are off campus, use the VPN.

The default home directory should be something like

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
/hpc/home/netID
```


## Getting started (Directory)

You can create your own directory in `/work`


```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cd /work
mkdir netID
```


```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cd /netID
ls -la
```


## Getting started (Groups)

As a user of the cluster computer, you are part of several groups:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
groups
```

Being a part of `statdept`, you have priority to run jobs on the following nodes:

- `dcc-herringlab-01`
- `dcc-statdept-01`
- `dcc-volfovskylab-01`

If you want to check the specifics of these nodes, you can run

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
ssh dcc-statdept-01
lscpu
```



## Getting started (file transfer)

Push a single file to DCC using a command like

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
scp <path_to_local_file> netID@dcc-slogin.oit.duke.edu:~/
```

Reverse the order of two paths to pull files from DCC.

Similarly, by adding the `-r` flag, you can push/pull a directory to/from DCC. For example, to push a directory `dir1/`

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
scp -r dir1/ netID@dcc-slogin.oit.duke.edu:~/
```

Other possibilities for file transfer include the app `RoyalTSX` (recommended for mac users)

Similarly, you can clone a git repository:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/STA-723/cluster_overview.git
cd cluster_overview/
```

## Available softwares on DCC

DCC offers some pre-installed softwares ("modules") that you can directly load and use. To check all available modules, run

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
module avail
```

To use a module, you have to load it; for example, 

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
module load R
```

which will load the latest version of R (3.6.0) on DCC. (And then you have to type "R" in the command line to actually run R.)

After using a module, you have to unload it; for example, 

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
module unload R
```


## Slurm basics

First principle of DCC:

### NEVER run jobs on the log-in nodes!

Always request a session via Slurm commands. 

Slurm is a cluster management and job scheduling system. Basically, you use Slurm to request nodes, submit computing jobs and monitor those jobs. 

You can run interactive sessions or submit jobs through simple commands or a short script.
